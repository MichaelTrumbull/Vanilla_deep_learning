# Vanilla Deep Learning
This project is an attempt to build neural networks without any numerical frameworks such as PyTorch, TensorFlow, or even NumPy. As a jumping off place I used this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8yWXqWQYmU) to build a 2 layer feed forward NN using NumPy. Using this as a template, I built my own methods to replace the NumPy used (python/vanillaPY_neuralnet.py).

The training data used is the classic MNIST hand written numbers training set.
### To do
[x] Build NumPy Free deep learning network
[ ] Build the same network in C using the same functions developed
[ ] Build C++ variation with the layers represented as objects and an implementation of Autodifferentiation for backpropogation
